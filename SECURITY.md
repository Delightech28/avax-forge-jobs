# Security Measures

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the AVAX Forge Jobs platform.

## Authentication Security

### Email Role Separation
- **Prevention of Cross-Role Registration**: Users cannot use the same email address to register as both a job seeker and an employer
- **Role Validation**: Each email address is tied to exactly one role (user or company)
- **Clear Error Messages**: Users receive specific feedback when attempting to use an email that's already registered with a different role

### Password Security
- **Minimum Length**: Passwords must be at least 8 characters long
- **Complexity Requirements**: Passwords must contain:
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
  - At least one number (0-9)
  - At least one special character (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>)
- **Real-time Validation**: Password requirements are displayed during signup
- **Client-side Validation**: Immediate feedback on password strength

### Rate Limiting
- **Signup Rate Limiting**: Maximum 3 signup attempts per email per 15 minutes
- **Sign-in Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 sign-in attempts per email per 15 minutes
- **IP-based Protection**: Rate limiting is applied per email address
- **Automatic Reset**: Rate limits automatically reset after the time window

### Input Validation
- **Email Format Validation**: Strict email format validation using regex
- **Real-time Feedback**: Users receive immediate feedback on invalid inputs
- **Sanitization**: Email addresses are stored in lowercase for consistency

## Database Security

### Firestore Security Rules
- **User Data Protection**: Users can only read and write their own profile data
- **Role Immutability**: Users cannot change their role after account creation
- **Job Creation Restrictions**: Only company users can create job postings
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation of user data on creation

### Data Integrity
- **Email Consistency**: All emails are stored in lowercase format
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Creation and last login timestamps are recorded
- **Login Count Tracking**: Number of successful logins is tracked for security monitoring

## User Experience Security

### Clear Communication
- **Security Notices**: Users are informed about email role restrictions during signup
- **Password Requirements Display**: Clear list of password requirements shown during registration
- **Error Messages**: Specific, helpful error messages for different security violations

### Prevention Measures
- **Proactive Validation**: Email role conflicts are checked before account creation
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users receive instant feedback on security violations
- **Guidance Text**: Helpful text explaining security requirements

## Additional Security Features

### Session Management
- **Automatic Sign-in**: Users are automatically signed in after successful registration
- **Login Tracking**: Last login time and login count are recorded
- **Session Persistence**: Proper session management through Firebase Auth

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Security errors are handled gracefully without exposing system details
- **User-friendly Messages**: Error messages are user-friendly while maintaining security
- **Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring (client-side)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`: Enhanced authentication logic with security measures
- `src/pages/Auth.tsx`: Updated UI with security notices and validation feedback
- `src/utils/validation.ts`: Password and email validation utilities
- `src/utils/userValidation.ts`: Email role conflict checking utilities
- `firestore.rules`: Server-side security rules

### Key Functions
- `validatePassword()`: Comprehensive password strength validation
- `validateEmail()`: Email format validation
- `checkRateLimit()`: Rate limiting implementation
- `checkEmailRoleConflict()`: Email role conflict detection

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Additional Security Measures
1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Implement SMS or email-based 2FA
2. **Account Lockout**: Temporary account lockout after multiple failed attempts
3. **Email Verification**: Require email verification before account activation
4. **Password History**: Prevent reuse of recent passwords
5. **Session Timeout**: Implement automatic session timeout
6. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for security events
7. **IP Whitelisting**: Optional IP-based access restrictions
8. **CAPTCHA Integration**: Add CAPTCHA for high-risk operations

### Monitoring and Alerts
1. **Failed Login Monitoring**: Track and alert on suspicious login patterns
2. **Account Creation Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual account creation patterns
3. **Role Change Attempts**: Alert on attempts to change user roles
4. **Rate Limit Violations**: Monitor and alert on rate limit violations

## Compliance Notes

These security measures help ensure:
- **Data Protection**: User data is protected from unauthorized access
- **Account Integrity**: Each user has exactly one role per email address
- **System Security**: Protection against common attack vectors
- **User Trust**: Clear communication about security requirements
